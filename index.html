              <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
              <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety
                of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
              <code></code>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements
                    on
                    an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                    JavaScript
                    on
                    a
                    server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide
                    continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                    manipulations
                    on a server.</p>

              <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows
                most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason
                why
                it
                was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
              <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript
                has
                a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
                model
                provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
                also
                supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
                executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
              <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes,
                and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                you
                do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
                typed.</p>

              <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                With the keyword var. For example,<code>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
  
  By simply assigning it a value. For example,<code>x = 42.</code>This always declares a global variable. It generates
                a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

                With the keyword let. For example,<code>let y = 13.</code>This syntax can be used to declare a block
                scope
                local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
